## Executive Summary

Each platform has distinct strengths that make it suitable for different use cases:

**Builder.io** excels in website creation and visual editing with strong frontend capabilities. Its code generation approach offers good migration flexibility, making it an excellent choice for marketing sites and customer-facing web applications where design is critical. However, it has limitations in mobile development and healthcare-specific features.

**Retool** stands out for rapid internal tool development with excellent database and API integration. Developers particularly appreciate its intuitive interface and productivity benefits. It's ideal for data-heavy applications and administrative dashboards but less suitable for public-facing websites or mobile apps.

**OutSystems** provides the most comprehensive enterprise capabilities with excellent mobile app development and security features. It's the strongest option for healthcare applications requiring compliance and integration with clinical systems. However, this comes with the highest cost and steepest learning curve.

**Appsmith** offers the best value with its open-source option and strong database integration capabilities. It provides good development flexibility with moderate enterprise features. It's excellent for cost-conscious organizations needing internal tools but less suitable for complex mobile apps or marketing websites.

**Recommendation for healthcare RAD focus:** If budget allows and enterprise requirements are high, OutSystems provides the most comprehensive solution, especially for mobile and highly-regulated applications. For more cost-sensitive scenarios or primarily internal tools, Retool offers an excellent balance of capabilities and ease of use.
