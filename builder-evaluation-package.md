## Executive Summary

This package provides a comprehensive framework for evaluating Builder.io primarily as a low-code application development platform with secondary emphasis on content management capabilities. The evaluation focuses on:

1. **Validating low-code application development hypothesis:** "Builder.io can serve as the Visual App Builder in our Composition Tools Layer, enabling both low-code application development and content management within a unified platform that integrates with our Application Reference Architecture."

2. **Assessing Builder.io as a Salesforce low-code alternative:** Comparing capabilities, cost, and ease of use against Salesforce and other low-code platforms for application development.

3. **Testing integration with our application architecture:** Validating Builder.io's ability to work within our multi-layered application reference architecture and connect with our specified technologies.

4. **Evaluating omni-channel content management:** As a secondary goal, assessing Builder.io's capabilities for centralized content creation and delivery across web, email, and native mobile applications.

This document contains structured evaluation criteria, detailed test scenarios for both application development and content management, and a competitive analysis matrix to guide your assessment.

- Inconsistent brand experiences across channels
- Lack of integration between application development and content management
- Siloed approaches to frontend and backend application development
- Limited capability for non-developers to participate in application creation

### Future Architecture Vision

We aim to transition to:
- Omni-channel Content Composer as the central hub
- Integration with Brand Design Kit and design systems
- Unified distribution to multiple channels (Web, Email, Native Apps)
